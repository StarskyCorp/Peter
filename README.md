## About Peter

Peter is a set of tools that may help you creating and testing your ASP.NET Core Minimal API's.

It provides:

- A test server ready to use for integration testing of your API, supporting secured endpoints.
- A type `Result<T>` useful to return both results and errors, from commands and queries, being able to map them to http results.
- A solution for Minimal API modules organization.
- API url discovery tools (not yet available).

## Packages

## Where does the name "Peter" come from?

There is a spanish expression *"No lo usa ni Peter"* than means "nobody use it!".

As this package is pretty new, we supose nobody is using it yet. We hope it will change soon.

## Getting started

Peter provides several components, let's see how to start with some of them. For further information go to the component documentation.
